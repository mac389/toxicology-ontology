# toxicology-ontology
The **purpose** of this web page is to provide a common access point for the development of the toxicologic ontology.  

1. Our first task is to translate the most recent edition of Goldfrank's _Toxicological Emergencies_ into an ontology. Ontologizing this canonical textbook will help identify and prioritize the objects and relations that the Toxicologic Ontology needs. 
2. We are, in parallel, creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to help crowdsource ontology development. 

### Quickstart 
1. Download the ontology in OWL format. (placeholder)
2. Link to GUI. (placeholder)


### Dependencies

The Toxicologic Ontology (TOXO) is a middle-level ontology that extends the Basic Formal Ontology and interacts with ChEBI (Chemical Entitie of Biological Interest), DIDEO (Drug-Drug Interaction Ontology) and [development here). 

### What is an Ontology? 

An ontology is a logicially consistent description of a portion of reality. The description enumerates all relevant entities in that portion of reality and their interactions. The current incarnation of TOXO uses binary relationships, although $n$-ary relationships and probabilistic relationships are a reasonable next step.
