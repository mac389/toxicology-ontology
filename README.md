# toxicology-ontology
The **purpose** of this web page is to provide a common access point for the development of the toxicologic ontology. Here is the current version of the ontology. 

### Quickstart 



### Dependencies

The Toxicologic Ontology (TOXO) is a middle-level ontology that extends the Basic Formal Ontology and interacts with ChEBI (Chemical Entitie of Biological Interest), DIDEO (Drug-Drug Interaction Ontology) and [development here). 

### What is an Ontology? 

An ontology is a logicially consistent description of a portion of reality. The description enumerates all relevant entities in that portion of reality and their interactions. The current incarnation of TOXO uses binary relationships, although $n$-ary relationships and probabilistic relationships are a reasonable next step. 



### Extension with Markov Logic Networks
